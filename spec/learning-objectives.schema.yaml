# Guidelines for Writing Learning Objectives
writing_guidelines:
  format: "ABCD Method"
  components:
    A: "Audience - Who is the learner?"
    B: "Behavior - What will the learner do? (measurable verb)"
    C: "Condition - Under what circumstances?"
    D: "Degree - How well must it be done?"

  good_examples:
    - objective: "After completing this chapter, the student will be able to implement a PID controller in Python that maintains robot position within 5% error."
      breakdown:
        audience: "the student"
        behavior: "implement a PID controller"
        condition: "After completing this chapter"
        degree: "within 5% error"
      bloom_level: "apply"

    - objective: "Given a robotic arm specification, learners will analyze the kinematic chain to determine the degrees of freedom."
      breakdown:
        audience: "learners"
        behavior: "analyze the kinematic chain"
        condition: "Given a robotic arm specification"
        degree: "determine the degrees of freedom"
      bloom_level: "analyze"

  poor_examples:
    - bad: "Understand robotics"
      problem: "Too vague, not measurable"
      better: "Explain the three laws of robotics and provide an example of each"

    - bad: "Know about sensors"
      problem: "'Know' is not measurable"
      better: "Identify five types of sensors used in robotics and describe the principle of operation for each"
